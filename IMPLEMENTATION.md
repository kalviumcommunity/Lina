# ðŸŽ¥ Video Script: Explaining System & User Prompt with RTFC Framework

---

### ðŸŸ¢ Intro (30s)

"Hi everyone, in this video Iâ€™ll explain how I designed the **System Prompt** and **User Prompt** for my backend project.
Iâ€™ll also show you how I applied the **RTFC framework â€“ Role, Task, Format, and Context â€“** to structure these prompts in a clear and consistent way."

### ðŸ”µ Part 1: System Prompt Explanation (2 min)

#### Narration:

"Letâ€™s start with the **System Prompt**.
The System Prompt defines how the AI should behave throughout the project.
Hereâ€™s the exact code snippet I used:"

#### On screen: (show code)

```js
export const systemPrompt = `
Role: You are an AI PDF Expert Assistant.
Task: Help users understand and interact with their uploaded PDFs by answering questions strictly based on PDF content.
Format: Always respond in strict JSON format:
{
  "answer": "",
  "summary": "",
  "key_points": []
}
Context: The user uploads a PDF document. Your job is to extract meaning, summarize sections, and answer questions without using external knowledge.
`;
```

#### Narration:

"Now let me break this down using the **RTFC framework**:

* **Role** â†’ I clearly define the AI as an *AI PDF Expert Assistant*. This sets its identity.
* **Task** â†’ The AIâ€™s main job is to help users understand their PDFs and answer questions based only on the document.
* **Format** â†’ I specify that the response must always be in strict JSON. This keeps answers machine-readable for my backend.
* **Context** â†’ I explain the environment: a user uploads a PDF, and the AI should never use outside knowledge â€“ only the PDFâ€™s content.

This structure ensures the AI is consistent, reliable, and aligned with my project needs."

### ðŸŸ  Part 2: User Prompt Explanation (1 min)

#### Narration:

"Next, letâ€™s look at the **User Prompt**.
The User Prompt takes the userâ€™s question and sends it to the AI in a clean and structured way."

#### On screen: (show code)

```js
export const createUserPrompt = (question) => `
User Question: ${question}
`;
```

#### Narration:

"Here, whenever a user asks a question, like *â€˜Summarize page 2â€™*, it gets wrapped into the **User Prompt** format:

ðŸ‘‰ `User Question: Summarize page 2`

This ensures that the AI always knows exactly what the user is asking, and it can respond following the JSON structure defined in the System Prompt."

---

### ðŸŸ£ Part 3: Why RTFC Matters (45s)

#### Narration:

"Using the **RTFC framework** makes my prompts predictable and professional:

* **Role** avoids confusion about AI identity.
* **Task** makes the AI goal-oriented.
* **Format** ensures structured outputs that the backend can process easily.
* **Context** keeps the AI focused on the uploaded PDF, avoiding hallucinations.

This way, my backend can reliably use the AIâ€™s responses for summaries, answers, or key points."

---

### ðŸŸ¢ Outro (20s)

"So thatâ€™s how I designed my **System Prompt** and **User Prompt**, and how the **RTFC framework** guided me.

Thanks for watching â€“ and if youâ€™re building an AI project, try structuring your prompts with RTFC for more control and consistency."




## ðŸŽ¤ **Video Script: Zero-Shot Prompting**

Hello everyone,

In this video, Iâ€™m going to explain what **Zero-Shot Prompting** is, how it works, and how Iâ€™ve implemented it in my backend project.

---

### **Introduction to Zero-Shot Prompting**

Letâ€™s begin with the basics.

Zero-shot prompting is a technique in AI prompting where you give an instruction or a query to the AI **without providing any prior examples or demonstrations**.

Think of it like this: you are giving the AI only the task description, and the model has to figure out the answer on its own, based on its training knowledge.

For example, if I say:
*"Translate this English sentence into French: I love programming."*

The AI immediately gives me the correct French translation: *"Jâ€™aime programmer."*

Notice here, I didnâ€™t give the AI any examples of English-to-French translations. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s called **Zero-Shot**.

---

### **Why Zero-Shot is Useful in My Project**

Now, letâ€™s connect this to my backend project.

In my project, the backend uses **system prompts and user prompts** to guide the AI when interacting with uploaded PDFs.

The system prompt defines the **role of the AI**, the **task it has to perform**, and the **format in which it should respond**.

The user prompt, on the other hand, contains the **actual question or query** that the user asks about their PDF.

Hereâ€™s where **zero-shot prompting** comes into play.

Since I want the AI to **answer questions about the PDF content** without showing it any training examples each time, I rely on zero-shot prompting.

So, if the user uploads a PDF and asks:
*"What is the summary of page 5?"*

The AI uses the instructions from the system prompt and the userâ€™s question to generate the answerâ€”without me giving it sample questions or answers beforehand.

---

### **How I Implemented Zero-Shot Prompting in Code**

Let me walk you through the code part.

Inside my backend project, I created a file called **`zero_shot_prompt.py`**.

Hereâ€™s the code:

```python
system_prompt = """
Role: You are an AI PDF Expert Assistant.
Task: Help users understand and interact with their uploaded PDFs by answering questions strictly based on PDF content.
Format: Always respond in strict JSON format:
{
  "answer": "",
  "summary": "",
  "key_points": []
}
Context: The user uploads a PDF document. Your job is to extract meaning, summarize sections, and answer questions without using external knowledge.
"""

def create_user_prompt(question: str) -> str:
    return f"User Question: {question}"
```

Now, when a user asks a question, for example:
*"What is the conclusion of this research paper?"*

The backend combines the **system prompt** and the **userâ€™s question**, and then sends it directly to the AI model.

Since I donâ€™t provide any training examples or few-shot examples here, this is a **pure zero-shot prompt**.

---

### **Benefits of Zero-Shot Prompting in This Case**

There are a few clear benefits of using zero-shot prompting here:

1. **Simplicity** â€“ I donâ€™t need to prepare or hard-code training examples.
2. **Flexibility** â€“ The user can ask any type of question about the PDF, and the AI can handle it.
3. **Lightweight** â€“ It reduces overhead because Iâ€™m not constantly passing examples with every query.

---

### **Conclusion**

So, to summarize:

* **Zero-shot prompting** means giving the AI only instructions, without examples.
* In my backend project, Iâ€™ve used it by combining a **system prompt** and a **user prompt** to guide the AI in answering PDF-related queries.
* This makes my system flexible, simple, and efficient.

Thatâ€™s how Iâ€™ve implemented **Zero-Shot Prompting** in my project.

Thank you for watching!
